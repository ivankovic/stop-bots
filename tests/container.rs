//! End-to-end tests against a *real* NGINX and a *real* nftables, in a
//! container.
//!
//! Everything else in `tests/` asserts the text this project generates.
//! That is exactly the check that keeps passing when the text is wrong —
//! a directive NGINX rejects, a rule `nft` won't load, a block that
//! returns 403 to the wrong requests. These tests run the generated
//! output through the actual parsers and then send actual requests at it.
//!
//! **They do not run by default.** They need a container runtime, take
//! tens of seconds, and would break `cargo test` on any machine without
//! one. Set `STOP_BOTS_CONTAINER_TESTS=1` to enable them; `make
//! integration-test` does that for you. CI runs them as their own job.
//!
//! ## Which runtime
//!
//! `docker` unless `STOP_BOTS_CONTAINER_RUNTIME` says otherwise, which is
//! what CI uses. Setting it to `podman` runs the same suite rootless —
//! see [`runtime()`] for why that option is here, and [`Host::boot`] for
//! the one place the two need different flags. Both are exercised; the
//! systemd assertions below were confirmed to still fail when their
//! directive is removed under each.
//!
//! ## Two images, because faithfulness is not free
//!
//! [`Server`] (`Dockerfile`, ubuntu:24.04) has **no init system**. It is
//! fast, needs only `NET_ADMIN`, and is what the NGINX and nftables tests
//! use — `nginx -s reload` stands in for `systemctl reload nginx`. What it
//! is faithful about is the two parsers this project cannot check any
//! other way.
//!
//! [`Host`] (`Dockerfile.host`, debian:13) runs **real systemd as PID 1**.
//! It exists because that "no init system" line above was, for a while,
//! the reason three separate bugs reached a live server: `install web`
//! failing with `203/EXEC` because the unit's `ProtectHome=yes` hid the
//! binary, the firewall apply failing because `RestrictAddressFamilies`
//! omitted `AF_NETLINK`, and a deploy that replaced the binary without
//! restarting anything. Every one of those is a property of the generated
//! unit under a real service manager, and no amount of asserting on the
//! unit's *text* finds them — the text was what everyone had already
//! read.
//!
//! Tests on `Host` derive their probes from the unit `install web`
//! actually wrote (see [`Host::oneshot_under_web_sandbox`]) rather than
//! from a hand-written copy, and the sandbox ones each carry a negative
//! control that removes the directive under test and asserts the failure
//! comes back. Without that control, a container where the sandbox
//! silently did not apply would pass every one of them.
//!
//! ## And a stranger's host
//!
//! `Dockerfile.stranger` is a fresh Debian 12 or Ubuntu 24.04 with nothing
//! of ours on it, for [`a_stranger_follows_the_quick_start`]: the README's
//! quick start from `apt install` of the `.deb` to `uninstall all`. It
//! needs a package, named by `STOP_BOTS_STRANGER_DEB`, and skips without
//! one; `make stranger-test` builds one and runs it.
